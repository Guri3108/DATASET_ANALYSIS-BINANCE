# Binance Trading Performance Analysis Documentation

## Methodology

### 1. Data Processing
- **Input**: CSV file containing portfolio IDs and trade history in JSON format
- **Processing Steps**:
  - Parse JSON trade history for each portfolio
  - Clean and validate trade data
  - Classify trades by position type (long/short, open/close)
  - Convert timestamps to datetime format

### 2. Performance Metrics Calculation
- **ROI (Return on Investment)**
  - Calculated as: (Total Profit / Total Investment) * 100
  - Uses absolute quantity values for investment calculation

- **Sharpe Ratio**
  - Daily returns calculated from realized profits
  - Risk-free rate assumed at 2% annually
  - Formula: (Returns Mean - Risk Free Rate) / Returns Standard Deviation

- **Maximum Drawdown (MDD)**
  - Calculated using daily cumulative returns
  - Represents largest peak-to-trough decline
  - Formula: (Current Value - Peak Value) / Peak Value

- **Win Rate**
  - Ratio of profitable trades to total trades
  - Profit determined by positive realizedProfit values

### 3. Portfolio Ranking
- **Composite Score Components**:
  - ROI (30% weight)
  - Sharpe Ratio (30% weight)
  - Win Rate (20% weight)
  - Inverse MDD (20% weight)
- All metrics normalized before weighted combination

## Assumptions

1. **Data Quality**
   - Trade history is complete and accurate
   - All timestamps are in milliseconds
   - realizedProfit accurately reflects trade outcomes

2. **Risk Calculations**
   - Risk-free rate of 2% annually
   - Daily returns are normally distributed
   - No transaction costs considered

3. **Position Classification**
   - Trades classified based on side and positionSide
   - All trades are properly paired (open/close)

4. **Portfolio Ranking**
   - Equal importance of risk and return metrics
   - Linear relationship between metrics and performance

## Limitations

1. **Data Constraints**
   - Limited to 90-day historical data
   - No consideration of unrealized positions
   - Market conditions not factored

2. **Metric Calculations**
   - Sharpe Ratio assumes normal distribution
   - ROI calculation simplified for comparison
   - MDD sensitive to time period

3. **Ranking System**
   - Weights are predetermined
   - May not reflect all trading strategies

## Recommendations

1. **Data Enhancement**
   - Include longer historical periods
   - Add market context data
   - Track unrealized positions

2. **Metric Refinement**
   - Consider alternative risk measures
   - Add strategy-specific metrics
   - Include transaction costs

3. **Analysis Extension**
   - Add strategy classification
   - Include market condition correlation
   - Develop strategy-specific rankings

## Technical Notes

1. **Performance**
   - Processing time scales with trade history size
   - Memory usage depends on portfolio count
   - Batch processing recommended for large datasets

2. **Error Handling**
   - Missing data handled gracefully
   - Invalid trades logged and skipped
   - Portfolio minimum requirements enforced

3. **Output Format**
   - Reports in plain text and CSV
   - Visualizations in PNG format
   - Data preserved in original precision
